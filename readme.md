# Perch Minimalist Admin Theme

An admin theme for Perch CMS and Perch Runway that improves the editing experience for clients. It adds contrast, a bit more visual hierarchy, and a more modern feel to the admin UI. 


## Installation

 1. Copy the contents of `/perch-admin-theme/dist` to `/perch/admin/addons/plugins/ui`. (**Note:** If a `/plugins/ui` folder doesn't exist, create one.)
 2. You're all done!

 - `perch_admin_theme.css` | *v 1.2, cleans up the Perch admin UI*
 - `font_awesome.css` *v 4.7.0, facilitates icons on some UI elements.*
